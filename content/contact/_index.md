The PG Conference is a three-day conference organised by the Postgraduate Researches in the School of Mathematics.
It's an opportunity for PGRs in the school to present their work, learn about their colleagues research, and be introduced to new skills.

The talks are presented by the PGRs, and there are a few selected sessions for workshops, career discussions and one external general interest talk.
