title: "Call for Speakers"
---

We are excited to announce the Leeds School of Mathematics Postgraduate Research Conference, to be held on the 14th-16th of June 2023 in the School of Mathematics building. This conference aims to provide an opportunity for postgraduate researchers to present their work and exchange ideas with their peers. We were very pleased with the level of engagement from the interest check and are looking forward to receiving many interesting proposals.


We invite PGRs from all groups and years to submit proposals for talks or poster presentations. We do not require a final title/abstract at this point, just a rough idea of what the presentation will be about. The submission deadline for the call for speakers is the 31st of May.


Talks are limited to 15 minutes plus 5 minutes for questions and will be delivered in the MALL. Posters will be on display for the duration of the conference, and a dedicated poster session will also be scheduled (date and time TBD). Please note participants are required to print out their own posters.

 

To submit your proposal, please fill out this form.

We hope to hear from you soon!
